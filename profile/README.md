Welcome to **Project MagicEagle**, a comprehensive Object-Oriented software simulation of the EuroFighter Typhoon fighter aircraft. This project aims to meticulously recreate the avionics, control systems, and operations of the EuroFighter, making it a detailed fighter aircraft simulation.

## **Project Overview**
The EuroFighter Typhoon is a multi-role fighter jet with state-of-the-art technologies. Project MagicEagle is dedicated to simulating every possible aspect of this aircraft, from basic functions like cockpit lighting to advanced systems like radar, flight controls, weapons systems, and much more.

## **Project Goals**
- **High-Fidelity Simulation:** Achieve a near-realistic software simulation by implementing all critical and minor aircraft systems using object-oriented design principles.
- **Modularity and Scalability:** Design a modular architecture to allow flexibility and potential for adding new systems and upgrades in the future.
- **Educational and Enthusiast-Oriented:** Serve as an educational project for aviation enthusiasts, software engineers, and aerospace professionals interested in aviation systems and software development.

## **Key Features**
- **Flight Control Systems**: Accurate modeling of primary and secondary flight control surfaces, including ailerons, rudders, flaps, elevators, and more.
- **Weapon Systems**: Detailed implementation of different types of ordnance such as missiles, bombs, and cannons with customizable loadouts.
- **Avionics and Sensors**: Simulation of avionics systems, navigation controls, radar, and real-time sensor data for target acquisition and flight monitoring.
- **Engine and Fuel Systems**: Realistic engine startup and shutdown sequences, fuel consumption modeling, and engine performance.
- **Defense and Communication Systems**: Implementation of electronic countermeasures, secure communication links, and real-time in-flight alerts.
- **Cockpit Systems**: Simulation of all cockpit displays, indicators, and interactive switches.

## **Architecture**
The simulation is structured using Java-based object-oriented design principles with an emphasis on modularity. The main modules of the project include:
- **Flight Control System**
- **Engine and Fuel Management System**
- **Navigation and Radar Systems**
